## Hi All 👋


🙋‍♀️ 
```python
Hello world! 
```

Welcome to **Tianyi**'s repo!

The profile picture shows my favorite animal: **red panda**.

<img alt="red panda" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94179278/141875135-585420bc-3679-482e-9ade-3f5147872d4a.jpg" width="400"/>
The red panda (*Ailurus fulgens*) is a carnivoran native to the eastern Himalayas and southwestern China.

I lived abroad for 6 out of the past 10 years. Four years in the US, a year in France and another in Germany.
I majored in Finance and Accounting for my Bechelor's and Strategic Management for my Master's.

Here're a couple of pictures from back in the days:

I look forward to learning about programming as well as all of you -- my future colleagues!

Let's me share a quote from **Phil Jackson**, former headcoach of the LA Laker's
