## Hi All 👋


🙋‍♀️ Hello world! Welcome to Tianyi's repo!

The profile picture shows my favorite animal: **red panda**.

The red panda (*Ailurus fulgens*) is a carnivoran native to the eastern Himalayas and southwestern China.

I lived abroad for 6 out of the past 10 years. Four years in the US, a year in France and another in Germany.
I majored in Finance and Accounting for my Bechelor's and Strategic Management for my Master's.

Here're a couple of pictures from back in the days:

I look forward to learning programming as well as all of you -- my future colleagues!

Let's me share a quote from **Phil Jackson** former headcoach of the LA Laker's

>Some play to play, some play to win. Who are you?
